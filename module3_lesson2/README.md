Logic of sql_project_planning
Using MySQL
Select Start_Date not in the End_Date, and select End_Date not in Start_Date, and then cross join these two. 
Select Min(End_Date) and filter by Start_Date < End_Date and order by Datediff(,). 
Datediff takes only two expressions and separated by a comma, instead of a minus sign.
